<<<<MAIN>>>>>>
JavaScript has several looping structures, including:
--> For loop
--> while loop
--> Do while loop
--> for of loop
--> for in loop
--> for each loop 

Thread below to understand each of these loops 

<<<<<ONE>>>

The For Loop
for loop: used to execute a block of code a specific number of times

<<<<<TWO>>>>>
A while loop
1. A while loop evaluates the condition inside the parenthesis ().
2. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed.
3. The condition is evaluated again.
4. This process continues until the condition is false.

<<<<<THREE>>>>>
Do while loop
1.The body of the loop is executed at first. Then the condition is evaluated.
2.If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.
3.The condition is evaluated once again.
4.If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.

<<<<<FOUR>>>>>
For of loop
The for of loop can be used to iterate over an array.
The for...of loop is used to iterate through the values of an iterable.	

<<<<<FIVE>>>>

For in loop 
The for...in loop iterates over the properties of an object
The for...in loop can iterate over arrays and array-like objects but it is not recommended use for of loop instead.
The for...in loop returns all properties and inherited properties for an array or array-like object, which can lead to unexpected behavior.


<<<<<<SIX>>>>>>
forEach loop

The forEach() method calls a function and iterates over the elements of an array. The forEach() method can also be used on Maps and Sets.

<<<Seven>>>

Comparison
for...of	for...in
The for...of loop is used to iterate through the values of an iterable.	
The for...in loop is used to iterate through the keys of an object.
The for...of loop cannot be used to iterate over an object.	
You can use for...in to iterate over an iterable such arrays and strings but you should avoid using for...in for iterables.

Exercise Give yourself a challenge 

Write a fucntion using for loop that will check if two strings are palindromes. A palindrome is a word that spells the same forward and backward.
Examples: racecar or javascript
