<<<<MAIN>>>>

Classes are one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript.

A class is a blueprint for the object. You can create an object from the class.

You can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions, you build the house. House is the object.

Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.

<<<<ONE>>>>>
The constructor function is defined as:

<<<<<<TWO>>>>>>
Constructor
The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. 
There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class â€” a SyntaxError is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.

You can create instance properties inside the constructor:

<<<<<THREE>>>>>
Javascript Class Methods
Methods are defined on the prototype of each class instance and are shared by all instances. 
Methods can be plain functions, async functions, generator functions, or async generator functions.

<<<<<<FOUR>>>>>
Getters and Setters
JavaScript classes may include getters and setters. You use the get keyword for getter methods and set for setter methods.

<<<<<<FIVE>>>>>
Hoisting
A class should be defined before using it. Unlike functions and other JavaScript declarations, the class is not hoisted.

<<<<<SIX>>>>>>
'use strict'
Classes always follow 'use-strict'. All the code inside the class is automatically in strict mode.

<<<<<<SEVEN>>>>
Class Inheritance
Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.

Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.

Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.

JavaScript super() keyword

<<<<<<NINE>>>>>>
Overriding Method or Property
If a child class has the same method or property name as that of the parent class, it will use the method and property of the child class

<<<<<<TEN>>>>>>
 Uses of Inheritnace 
1. Since a child class can inherit all the functionalities of the parent's class, this allows code reusability.
2. Once a functionality is developed, you can simply inherit it. No need to reinvent the wheel. This allows for cleaner code and easier to maintain.
3. Since you can also add your own functionalities in the child class, you can inherit only the useful functionalities and define other required features.
