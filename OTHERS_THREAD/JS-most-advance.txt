<<<MAIN>>>
As a language model, I don't have access to current trends or what is popular at the moment, 
but here are some suggestions for interesting topics related to JavaScript that many people may not be aware of:

These are just a few examples of the many advanced features of JavaScript that may not be widely known, 
but can greatly enhance your understanding and capabilities as a JavaScript developer.
<<ONE>>
JavaScript Proxy: 

The JavaScript Proxy API allows you to intercept and modify operations performed on an object. 
This can be useful for creating custom objects with specific behaviors.

<<TWO>>>
JavaScript Iterators and Generators: 

JavaScript iterators allow you to define a sequence of values that can be iterated over, 
while generators allow you to generate values on demand. 
These features are powerful tools for creating custom data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

<<THREEE>>>
JavaScript Destructuring: 

The destructuring assignment syntax allows you to extract values from arrays or objects 
and assign them to variables with a concise and readable syntax.

<<<FOUR>>>
JavaScript Modules: 
Modules are a way to organize your code into reusable and maintainable units, 
and the ES6 module system provides a standardized way to include and reuse code across your projects.

<<<FIVE>>>
JavaScript Worker Threads: 

JavaScript worker threads allow you to run scripts in the background, separate from the main thread,
 to improve the performance and responsiveness of your web applications.

<<<SIX>>>>
JavaScript Rest/Spread Operators: 
The rest and spread operators allow you to more easily manipulate arrays and objects, and can make your code more concise and readable.
