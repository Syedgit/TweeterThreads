import and export provide a powerful way to organize and reuse code in your JavaScript projects. 
You can create multiple modules that export values or functions, 
and then import them as needed into other modules, making it easier to maintain and scale your code
.
Introduction to import and export: import and export are features of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and allow you to include and reuse code from other JavaScript files. 
An export statement is used to export values or functions from a module, while an import statement is used to import values or functions into a module.
