To master Javascript you have to understand objects as everything in JS is object.
Below topics will help you understand basics of Objects that is minimium needed on first job.

1 Introduction to objects 
2 Creating objects 
3 Adding Properties & Methods
3 Accessing data in objects 
4 Modification of objects 
5 Object Methods


<<<<<2>>>>>

->JavaScript object is a non-primitive data-type that allows you to store multiple collections of data.

-> An object is a JavaScript data type, just as a number or a string is also a data type. As a data type, an object can be contained in a variable.

There are two ways to construct an object in JavaScript:

1.The object literal, which uses curly brackets: {}
2.The object constructor, which uses the new keyword

Properties and Methods
--> Objects can have properties and methods.

--> A property is the association between a name (key) and value within an object, and it can contain any datatype. A property generally refers to the characteristic of an object.

--> A method is a function that is the value of an object property, and therefore a task that an object can perform.
There are two ways to access an object’s properties.

1. Dot notation: .
2. Bracket notation: []

const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "axe",
	greet: function() {
		return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}!`;
	},
};

<<<<<4>>>>>
Adding and Modifying Object Properties
In order to add a new property to an object, you would assign a new value to a property with the assignment operator (=).

For example, we can add a numerical data type to the gimli object as the new age property. Both the dot and bracket notation can be used to add a new object property.

// Add new age property to gimli
gimli.age = 139;
// Add new age property to gimli
gimli["age"] = 139;
We can access that value just as above, with either the dot notation or the bracket notation.

gimli.age;
Output
139

A method can also be added to the object by using the same process.

// Add new fight method to gimli
gimli.fight = function() {
	return `Gimli attacks with an ${this.weapon}.`;
}
Once we have created this new object method, we can call it as we did above.

gimli.fight();
Output
"Gimli attacks with an axe."
Using the same method, an object’s property can be modified by assigning a new value to an existing property.

// Update weapon from axe to battle axe
gimli.weapon = "battle axe";
At this point, if we call the object, we will see all of our additions and modifications.

gimli;
Output
{name: "Gimli", race: "dwarf", weapon: "battle axe", age: 139, greet: ƒ, fight: ƒ}

Removing Object Properties
In order to remove a property from an object, you will utilize the delete keyword. delete is an operator that removes a property from an object.

In the below example, we will remove the weapon property from gimli using delete.

// Remove weapon from gimli
delete gimli.weapon;
Output
true

<<<<<<6>>>>>>>

Looping Through Object Properties
JavaScript has a built-in type of for loop that is specifically meant for iterating over the properties of an object. This is known as the for...in loop.

Here is a simplified version of our main object example, gimli.

const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "battle axe",
};
We can use for...in to traverse through all the properties of gimli and print them to the console. Using bracket notation, we can retrieve the property value as a variable, in this case key.

// Iterate through properties of gimli
for (let key in gimli) {
  console.log(gimli[key]);
}
Output
Gimli
dwarf
battle axe

Object Keys
There are some cool methods available in Object that helps us with looping 

The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.
const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};

console.log(Object.keys(object1));
// expected output: Array ["a", "b", "c"]

<<<<8>>>>>>
Object Values()
The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values.

const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};

console.log(Object.values(object1));
// expected output: Array ["somestring", 42, false]


<<<<<9>>>>

Object.entries()
The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.

const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42
};

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(object1)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

// expected output:
// "a: somestring"
// "b: 42"


<<<<<<<10>>>>>>

Object.assign()
The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.

<<Code_Image>>>>

<<<<<<11>>>>>>

Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()
The hasOwnProperty() method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).

const object1 = {};
object1.property1 = 42;

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('property1'));
// expected output: true

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('toString'));
// expected output: false

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty'));
// expected output: false
